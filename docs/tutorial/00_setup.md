# Setup for Tutorial

## Installation of napari and napari-ndev

You have two options to download `napari` and `napari-ndev`. For users unfamiliar with using the command line and python, I would recommend following the instructions at [Beginner Setup](beginner_setup.md). Then, be sure to use the `napari-console` to install the full version using [the instructions](beginner_setup.md#napari-ndev-full-installation).

If you are familiar with python, then I would recommend creating a new environment and to do a fresh installation of with `napari-ndev[all]`. Further details available in [Installation](installation.md).
