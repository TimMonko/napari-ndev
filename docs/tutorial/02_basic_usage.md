# Basic Usage Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to get a user familiar with generating annotations, workflows, and machine learning classifiers. Unlike the [Example Pipeline Tutorial](01_example_pipeline.md), this tutorial just provides raw images and hints on how to progress.

The skills practiced in this will be used on relatively small, 2D images; however, things are intended to generally transfer to both 3D and higher dimensional datasets.

## Easy Machine Learning Setup

### Sparse annotation with Image Utilities

### Generation of a Feature Set with APOC Widget

### Training a Machine Learning Classifier

### Predicting with a Machine Learning Classifier

## Build your own Workflow

### Annotating regions of interest with Image Utilities

### Using the napari-assistant to generate a workflow

### Applying your workflow in batch with the Workflow Widget

## Notes on multi-dimensional data

Overall, most of the plugin should be able to handle datasets that have time, multi-channel, and 3D data. Try exploring the `Lund Timelapse (100MB)` sample data from `Pyclesperanto` in napari.
